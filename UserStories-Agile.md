# User Stories

Accessible through the App Studio, User Stories contain desired features soon-to-come to apps.

A User story consists of a name, description, associated feature, owner, and other details pertaining to new features and application add-ons. User Stories are the meat-and-potatoes of Agile Environments. It allows teams to keep track of new developments and what is currently being worked on.
